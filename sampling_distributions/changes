- Rename variable names so that we can use area and price
    - price <- SalePrice
    - area <- Gr.Liv.Area
- Remove the assignment at the beginning of the lab so that 
variables can stay in the data frame
- Sample with replacement!
    - This change should be made on other versions as well
- 50,000 samples -> 2,000 samples (for runtime)
- Use `do()` instead of `for` loops
    - Requires `mosaic` package
